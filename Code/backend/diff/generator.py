# generator.py — Diff Engine
# This module compares old and new code, generates a unified diff,
# and produces a summary of changes.
#
# Responsibilities:
# - Take old_code and new_code as strings
# - Generate GitHub-style unified diff using difflib
# - Count added, removed, modified lines
# - Return JSON-friendly output:
#     { "diff": "...", "summary": "..." }
# - Provide safe fallback if diff fails
